# Moonboard-Data
This repository contains tools for processing the Moonboard rock climbing hold problems to extract the holds that are used in the problem. It also seeks to create a webcrawler to create a labelled dataset of Moonboard problems, and their difficulties to be used in later projects (classification of problems, and generation of problems).
